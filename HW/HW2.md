### Various Approaches to Storage Management on iOS and Their Pros and Cons:

#### UserDefaults
UserDefaults is a simple key-value storage system in iOS that allows you to persist small pieces of data, such as user preferences, settings, or lightweight app states. It’s ideal for storing information like theme settings, login states, or feature flags.

- **Pros**:
  - Easy to implement and use.
  - Perfect for small, simple data like user settings or preferences.
  - Automatically synchronized across launches.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Not suitable for large or complex data.
  - Lack of structure for managing relational or hierarchical data.
  - Limited to relatively simple types such as strings, integers, and booleans.

#### Core Data
Core Data is a robust framework that allows for object graph management and persistence. It’s typically used for apps that need to store and manipulate complex data models, such as relational data with multiple entities and attributes.

- **Pros**:
  - Excellent for managing complex data models with relationships.
  - Supports advanced querying and filtering.
  - Built-in features like undo/redo, versioning, and change tracking.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Steeper learning curve compared to simpler options like UserDefaults.
  - Overhead in terms of setup and performance tuning.
  - Can be overkill if you only need to store simple data.

#### SQLite
SQLite is a relational database system embedded in iOS. It’s used when you need fine control over how data is structured and queried. It is ideal for apps with large datasets that require complex queries and data manipulation.

- **Pros**:
  - High performance for large datasets and complex queries.
  - Complete control over database schema and SQL operations.
  - Suitable for structured, relational data.
  
- **Cons**:
  - More complexity compared to Core Data or UserDefaults.
  - Requires manual management of database structure and indexing.
  - Not integrated with Swift’s type system, requiring more code to handle data transformation.

#### File System (Documents Directory)
The file system approach allows you to store data directly in the app’s Documents or Cache directories, making it suitable for large media files such as images, videos, or PDFs.

- **Pros**:
  - Great for storing large files (e.g., media, PDFs) that don’t require frequent querying.
  - Offers direct control over file storage and access.
  
- **Cons**:
  - No built-in structure for querying or relational data.
  - Requires manual handling of file integrity and organization.
  - Can become inefficient for complex data operations.

#### Keychain
Keychain is a secure storage solution in iOS for storing sensitive data, such as passwords, encryption keys, or tokens. It provides strong security and encryption.

- **Pros**:
  - Highly secure, automatically encrypted by the system.
  - Best for storing sensitive data such as credentials and keys.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Not suitable for non-sensitive or complex data.
  - Can only store limited types of data such as strings or small binary blobs.
